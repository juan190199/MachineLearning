### Fundamentals of Machine Learning (FML)

1. Supervised Learning
    * Threshold classifier
    * Nearest Neighbor classifier
    * Nearest Mean classifier
    * Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
    * Linear Discriminant Analysis
    * Density Tree and Decision Tree
    * Density Forest and Decision Forest
    * Linear Regression and Regression Tree

2. Unsupervised Learning

3. Feature and model selection
    * K-Fold Cross Validation

4. Extras
    * Inverse Transform Sampling: For generative models, one can create data using a random number generator.
      Specifically, one first samples an instance label Y according to the prior probabilities,
      and then uses the corresponding likelihood to sample the feature X. If no predefined random
      generator for the desired likelihood is available, uniformly distributed samples from a
      standard random number generator can be transformed to the desired distribution by means of
      'inverse transform sampling' [see reference] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling)
