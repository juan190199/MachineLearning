2. Unsupervised Learning

3. Feature and model selection
    * K-Fold Cross Validation

4. Extras
    * Inverse Transform Sampling:

      For generative models, one can create data using a random number generator. Specifically, one first samples an
      instance label Y according to the prior probabilities, and then uses the corresponding likelihood to sample the
      feature X. If no predefined random generator for the desired likelihood is available, uniformly distributed
      samples from a standard random number generator can be transformed to the desired distribution by means of
      'inverse transform sampling' ([see reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling))

    * Principal Component Analysis
    * Singular Value Decomposition
